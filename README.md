# PROJECT:
## "LATERAL RESPONSE OF PILE DUE TO COMBINED LOAD FOR FREE AND FIXED HEAD CONDITIONS USING PYTHON SOFTWARE AND EXCEL"

## ABSTRACT:
>  Pile foundations are used to support both vertical and horizontal loads in many geotechnical projects, such as coastal and offshore engineering. In designing pile foundations to resist lateral and axial loads, the criterion for design in most cases is not the ultimate lateral capacity of the piles, but the maximum deflection of the piles. In this project, for the combined loads (axial and lateral), the lateral response of pile in terms of deflection for free and fixed head conditions is proposed based on the subgrade reaction approach. Firstly, for the assumed pile and soil conditions, the behaviour of the pile subjected to lateral load is analysed for effects of various parameters like pile head fixity, the cohesion of surrounding soil, pile diameter, and length of the pile. Then the deflection profile of the pile subjected to combined lateral and axial loads is investigated finally. From the analytical observations of combined loading, it is assessed that in free head condition, when the lateral load is increased from 100 kN to 1000kN then the pile top deflection increased by nearly 90% whereas no significant increase is observed for fixed head condition. For free head condition, when the moment is increased from minimum value of 40 -100 kN.m to maximum of 1000 -3000 kN.m then the pile top deflection almost increased by 67% but no significant increase is observed for fixed head condition. Similarly, when diameter of the pile is increased from 0.4m to 1m, the pile top deflection decreases by 48.6% in case of free head condition whereas for fixed head condition the decrease in the pile top deflection is 99.95%. In case of increase of cohesion of surrounding soil from 20 to 100 kN, the pile top deflection decreases by 81.2% for free head condition and no significant increase is observed for fixed head condition. A computer program is developed in python code to determine the lateral response of pile subjected to combined lateral and axial load for various soil and pile parameters. Keywords: subgrade reaction approach, fixed head pile, free head pile, lateral deflection, lateral load, axial load, combined loading, pile top deflection.
